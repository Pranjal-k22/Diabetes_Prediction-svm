# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction System using SVM

A machine learning-based diagnostic tool to predict whether a person is diabetic or not, using the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This project is built using Python and Scikit-learn and can serve as a solid foundation for more advanced healthcare analytics systems.
